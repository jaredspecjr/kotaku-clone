for this independent project I have chosen to work on re-creating Kotaku.com
one of my favorite video game blogs

# Kotaku-clone


### By Jared Lutz

## Description
This is a website designed to look just like Kotaku.com

## Programs used
basic html and css was used to create this replica site

#IMPORTANT
I do not own anything Kotaku related, nothing on this site is functional as is purely to display my ability to use flexboxes and grids in css

There are two images in the root folder of this project that you may view,
alternatively if you would like to compare my work you may visit http://kotaku.com
to view the original site, and check out my version of the site here: http://jaredspecjr.github.io/kotaku-clone
I recommend the latter as you will be able to see how the site is responsive.
